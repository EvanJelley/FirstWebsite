            <p>Foundational has unfortunately become an overused epithet to ascribe significance to often forgotten or unimportant works. However, in the case of the Iliad it is no more rightly bestowed. Western culture has two equal origins: The Hebrews and The Greeks. While the Torah resides at the base of the immense edifice that is Hebrew culture, so too, Homer is the bedrock of the Greeks. If one wishes to understand the Greek psyche and way of life it is inevitably begun with the Iliad. </p>
            <p>I admittedly was unfamiliar with the contents of the Iliad up till this first reading. I had the vague knowledge that it held an account of the Trojan war. So, I of course assumed it contained all of the common cultural references that we make to the Trojan War. Namely, the judgement of Paris, the theft of Helen, Achilles’ heel, and of course, the Trojan horse. It was only about midway through the tome that I became suspicious as to whether any of these stories would appear. They don’t. A fact which left me with some disappointment.</p>
            <p>This leaves the question: what is the story of the Iliad? This is a war story. Or is it a story of rage? Or is it both? While there is a good deal of war to be had within its pages (and a fair bit of violent imagery that may make even the hardiest reader squirm), I cannot help but see rage as the main theme of the poem. This should come as little surprise, as in the invocation the poet asks the goddess to sing not the ‘war of the Achaeans and Trojans’ but the ‘rage.’ The war is the backdrop. It is the setting for this rage. Which should provide some relief to my disappointment at the lack of the well known stories from Troy. This is not a war story. In fact we only see a small slice of the decade long campaign of the Achaeans in Troy. It is a story of rage.</p>
            <p>So whose rage? “Rage — Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus’ son Achilles.” (1.1). As I mentioned earlier, my knowledge of Achilles had previously only extended to his downfall at the hands of Paris. The imagine of the warrior himself had never been considered.</p>
            <p>Even in a piece as foundational as the Iliad there is a good deal of assumed knowledge from the reader (or perhaps, listener, in the case of Homer). Heroes like Achilles and Odysseus were like Napoleon or Winston Churchill. They required little introducing. As such, they received none. We are cast into the story “when the two first broke and clashed/ Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles." (1.8-1.9).</p>
            
            <br><h3>The Quarrel</h3>
            <p>While ostensibly the quarrel between Agamemnon and Achilles is over a woman. Pride plays a larger role. When the prophet, Calchas, reveals that the price for the safety of the Achaeans is the return of Chryseis, the daughter of the priest of Apollo and Agamemnon’s most recent spoil of war, Agamemnon responds as anyone might in the face of ill fate. He tries to shoot the messenger. “Seer of misery! Never a word that works to my advantage!” (1.124) Since a prophet is the messenger this might as well be the ancient equivalent of an ironic, “Well, isn’t that my luck?” Agamemnon is then primed to lash out at whoever dares to speak again.</p>
            <p>As any child knows all to well, if mom and dad are angry, then its safest in your room. Otherwise, you may become become collateral damage. The obvious difference here being that these are no parents and children. The exact nature of the ranks and relationship between Agamemnon and Achilles is perhaps a longer debate than for this commentary. However, what is evident is that Agamemnon stands in some position of power over Achilles, but to an extant. When Agamemnon insists that the prize he forfeits to appease Apollo be replaced by another Achilles is the one who tries to reason with him. He promises greater prizes when they conquest Troy.</p>
            <p>Then Agamemnon makes a crucial error. He reasserts his right to anyones prize:</p>
            <blockquote class="poetry">“I will take a prize myself — your own or Ajax’<br>
                or Odysseus’ prize — I’ll commandeer her myself<br>
                and let that man I go to visit choke with rage.” (1.161-63).</blockquote>
            <p>That last line reads with harsh prophetic irony. Agamemnon will come to eat those words. A good leader reminds his constituents as little as possible of his position of dominance. But, when it is necessary it should always be done for the good of the whole, and never for selfish intent. At least initially Agamemnon had shown the decency to (rather magnanimously) declare he was willing to give up his prize “if that is best for all. What I really want/ is to keep my people safe, not see them dying.” (1.135-136). However, after Achilles’ rebuttal he shows his true colors. He gives way to an almost childish anger at the will of fate showing he will use his rank to rectify it. This earns the expected response from Achilles: indignation.</p>
            <p>The choice that is left to Achilles is what he will do with his anger. “Should he draw the long sharp sword at his hip/ thrust through the ranks and kill Agamemnon now?—/ Or check his rage and beat his fury down?” (1.234-36). It is only the intervention of a goddess, Athena, on behalf of another goddess, Hera, that stays his hand. I am not quite sure if interpreting this as some intervention of Achilles’ conscience is appropriate here, but it is tempting. Regardless, he is forced to take the alternate route of stifling his anger for the time being.</p>
            <p>The long, steadfast, brooding rage of Achilles that ensues is surprisingly the more violent result of this encounter. While the lives of both Agamemnon and Achilles are saved for the time being, the rest of the Achaean army and ultimately, the Trojans as well, will pay the price for this resolution. Like Agamemnon’s comment on rage, Achilles words will also prove prophetic:</p>
            <blockquote class="poetry">“Someday, I swear, a yearning for Achilles will strike<br>
                Achaea’s sons and all your armies? But then, Atrides,<br>
                harrowed as you will be, nothing you do can save you—<br>
                not when your hordes of fighters drop and die,<br>
                cut down by the hand of man-killing Hector!” (1.281-85).
                </blockquote>
            <p>The price for Agamemnon’s theft of Briseis will be paid by Achaean blood. A fact which Achilles ensures will not be forgotten by reminding the two messengers sent to take her away to “bear witness” in case “the day should come when the armies need me/ to save their ranks from ignominious, stark defeat.” (1.403-4).</p>
            <p>Ironically, despite his knowledge of the affects of this quarrel on the whole, he makes it clear in his treatment of the messengers that he has no feud with them. His has a single minded hatred directed at Agamemnon. It will remain so for much of the story.</p>
